# Does-Money-buy-Baseball-games-

In this project, we are going to look at some baseball data! We would like to plot and visualize data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and gain some insights about players, teams, and salaries through the years in baseball.

We want to understand how efficient teams have been historically at spending money and getting wins in return. In the case of Moneyball, the movie, one would expect that Oakland was not much more efficient than other teams in their spending before 2000 but became much more efficient between the years 2000 and 2005. We would like to explore this hypothesis through the data and many visualizations.
